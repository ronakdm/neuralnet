# neuralnet
Implementation of a feed-forward neural network model from scratch.

The model is implemented using only `numpy` arrays, and can be found in `nn.py`. Multiple optimizers can be used as long as they are in a particular interface, with a simple version of steepest descent found in `optimizer.py`. Finally, `example.ipynb` tests each individual component of the implementation on small test cases.
